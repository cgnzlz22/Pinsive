#Technical Requirements

Your app must have:

*At least 2 models (more if they make sense) -- ideally a user model and one that represents the main functional idea for your app

*Include sign up/log in functionality, with hashed passwords & an authorization flow

*Incorporate at least one API. Examples include Yelp, Tumblr, Facebook, and others on Mashape.

*Have complete RESTful routes for at least one of your resources with GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE

*Utilize an ORM to create a database table structure and interact with your relationally-stored data

*Include wireframes that you designed during the planning process

*Have semantically clean HTML and CSS

*Be deployed online and accessible to the public


#Necessary Deliverables

A working full-stack application, built by you, hosted somewhere on the internet
A link to your hosted working app in the URL section of your Github repo
A git repository hosted on Github, with a link to your hosted project, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project. Commit early, commit often.
A readme.md file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.
Wireframes of your app, hosted somewhere & linked in your readme
A link in your readme.md to the publically-accessible user stories you created

#Progress:
*Day 1 - Planned out wireframe for initial idea/vision. Planned out routes for views. Created database. Got passport config to authenticate user.

*Day 2 - Studied/implemented API, installed additional npm modules that were not expected and ensured local host was wroking under https. Due to limitations of API, webscraped certain inforamtion which would be needed to make functional app.

*Day 3,4 - Implemented partials folder and public folders. Wrote out results.ejs and main.js(jQuery) in order to add functionality to results view and get a small sample of working app.

*Day 5 - Attempted to shuffle results in order to be a truly randomized generator app. Began styling.

*Day 6 - Attempted to deploy on heroku, continued to have issues and thus deployed on GitHub to at least have it deployed somewhere online and accessbile to public.

#Next Steps

*If I had another week, there are a few things I would work on.

*Truly randomize pins which are being generated as I believe it is picking from a very limited pool. 
*Add a profile page, just to illustrate who is logged in and the boards that they already have.
*Clean up my code!!!
